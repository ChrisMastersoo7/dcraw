This archive contains a modified version of dcraw,
provided originally by Dave Coffin. In addition to
mapping raw images to PNM or TIFF, this version creates
a text-encoded lookup table that is used to map the
intermediate linear gamma image into the target color
space, sRGB by default. Note that this version is only
used for JPEG-internal purposes and is not meant for
redistribution. Specifically, check the limitations at
the beginning of dcraw.c.
